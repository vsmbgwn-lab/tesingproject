# Project B — Retail Analytics & Recommendation Service (Scaffold)

This scaffold contains a minimal codebase to support the capstone Project B:
- data ingestion (upload sample CSV to Cloud Storage)
- processing job (Python) that reads CSV, writes processed JSON to processed/ and loads sample rows to Cloud SQL (placeholder)
- recommendation API (Flask) served on GKE
- dashboard (simple Express static page) hosted on Cloud Run
- Terraform placeholders and Cloud Build examples
